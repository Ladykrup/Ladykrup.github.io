<h1>Shanna Scott</h1>
<h1>Portfolio</h1>
<p>Shanna Scott is a contemporary painter in New York.  
Working from a small studio, she uses her classical training in oil painting and figure drawing in contemporary ways.</p> 
<br>
<p>Her bold paintings are an expression of life spent in wide-open spaces.</p>

<p>Shanna was born and raised on a ranch in Fort Worth, Texas.  Memories of big skies, cattle,  and pastureland influence her art.</p>
